The AI budget estimation assistant  takes a set of customer requirements for a SaaS product and generates a precise estimate of the man-hours required to complete the project. This was achieved with a custom-built machine-learning model that was trained on 40+ parameters describing dozens of projects completed over 2 years. 

What took Solution Consultants several weeks to achieve with project work-breadown planning and tedious requirements gathering can be achieved within minutes and with greater accuracy resulting in faster sales cycles and reduced cost overruns.
